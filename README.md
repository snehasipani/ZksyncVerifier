# ZkSync Verifier 🛡️✨

**Prove your creativity without revealing it.**

---

## 🔍 Problem

* Proving authorship or originality of digital work (art, code, design, docs) is hard.
* Existing methods rely on centralized platforms or exposing the entire file.
* Content can be copied, timestamps forged, or intellectual property stolen.
* On-chain storage of raw files is costly and leaks private data.

---

## ✅ Solution — ZkSync Verifier

ZkSync Verifier lets creators **prove ownership of their creative work** on-chain in a **cheap, scalable, and privacy-preserving way**.

* Generate a **zero-knowledge proof** of authorship without revealing the full file.
* Store only the **hash / IPFS CID** instead of the actual file.
* Verify ownership instantly on **ZkSync Era L2** with minimal gas fees.
* Optionally **mint an NFT** as a portable badge of creativity.

👉 In short: **“Proof without disclosure — creativity you can trust.”**

## ✨ Features

* 📂 **File Uploader** → upload a creative work, store CID on IPFS.
* 🔒 **Zero-Knowledge Proofs** → prove authorship without revealing the file.
* ⛓️ **Smart Contracts** → `ProofOfCreativity.sol`, `ProofNFT.sol`, deployable via Hardhat.
* 🖼️ **NFT Minting (optional)** → turn proofs into verifiable, portable NFTs.
* 💻 **Client-Side Verifier** → verify zk-proofs in browser (`lib/verifier.ts`).
* ⚡ **Cheap & Scalable** → runs on ZkSync Era (Ethereum L2).
* 🧑‍⚖️ **Judge-Friendly Demo** → `/app/demo` route for quick interactive testing.

## 🛠️ How It Works

1. **Upload** → File is hashed, CID stored on IPFS (not the raw file).
2. **Prove** → A zk-SNARK proof is generated showing knowledge of the file/CID.
3. **Verify** → Proof is verified on-chain or in browser using smart contracts + verifier lib.
4. **Mint (optional)** → Proof can be turned into an NFT (`ProofNFT.sol`) as a badge.
5. **Check** → Anyone can verify a proof in the `/app/proofs` UI.

## 🚀 Quickstart

1. `npm install`
2. Configure `.env` with your pinning service API key (e.g., web3.storage or Pinata) if you want user uploads pinned.
3. `npm run dev` to run the demo locally.
4. Use Hardhat to deploy contracts: `npx hardhat run --network zksync scripts/deploy.ts` (adjust network config).

## 🙋‍♀️ Notes & Recommendations

* For demo/hackathon use, web3.storage offers a simple free tier (1GB) and is recommended for quick onboarding.
* Never store pinning API keys in frontend code — keep them in server-side env or use a proxy.
* The `/app/demo` route is intentionally minimal to help judges validate functionality quickly without building locally.
